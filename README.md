### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jayson. Like many of you I am a human person. 

I use my talents to create solutions that are geared towards driving equity in the disparity in access to financial, educational, and health care solutions.

You may also recognise me as Mr. Potter of [Mr. Potter's](https://mrpotters.com).

Check out some of my design and development projects on [ðŸŽ¨ my portfolio](https://jaysonpotter.com).
